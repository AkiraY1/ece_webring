This is an update on the old Waterloo ECE webring, that is now deprecated and unactive. If you'd like to add your website, submit a PR and ensure the following things:

1. You have added your information to `members.js` and added an image to `public\people` in jpg / png format.
2. You have made changes _only_ in the above file / folder.

Once we've reviewed your PR, you will appear on the site :)
We hope to maintain this webring as well as the SE webring is maintained, s/o [@simcard0000](https://github.com/simcard0000).
